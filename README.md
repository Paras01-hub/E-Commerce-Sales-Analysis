# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis

This project involves analyzing an e-commerce dataset to uncover valuable insights about sales and profit trends. Using Python and its data analysis libraries, the analysis focuses on time-based metrics to help businesses understand their performance across different periods.

## Project Objectives
- Perform descriptive statistics on the dataset to understand the key metrics.
- Extract and analyze time-based columns (e.g., order month, order year, order day) from the data.
- Conduct sales and profit analysis to identify trends and patterns over time.

## Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Convert date columns to appropriate formats.
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Add new columns based on order dates, such as month, year, and day.
   - Generate time-based insights to aid in trend analysis.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Monthly sales trends.
   - Profit analysis by time periods.
   - Insights into order patterns to optimize business performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and presenting the workflow.
