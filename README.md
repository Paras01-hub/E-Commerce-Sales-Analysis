# E-Commerce Sales Analysis

This project involves analyzing an e-commerce dataset to uncover valuable insights about sales and profit trends. Using Python and its data analysis libraries, the analysis focuses on time-based metrics to help businesses understand their performance across different periods.

## Project Objectives
- Perform descriptive statistics on the dataset to understand the key metrics.
- Extract and analyze time-based columns (e.g., order month, order year, order day) from the data.
- Conduct sales and profit analysis to identify trends and patterns over time.

## Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Convert date columns to appropriate formats.
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Add new columns based on order dates, such as month, year, and day.
   - Generate time-based insights to aid in trend analysis.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Monthly sales trends.
   - Profit analysis by time periods.
   - Insights into order patterns to optimize business performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and presenting the workflow.

## Code for Key Questions

### 1. Monthly Sales Trends
```python
# Convert order date to datetime
orders['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(orders['order_date'])

# Extract year and month from order date
orders['year_month'] = orders['order_date'].dt.to_period('M')

# Group by year_month and calculate total sales
monthly_sales = orders.groupby('year_month')['sales'].sum()

# Plot the sales trend
monthly_sales.plot(kind='line', title='Monthly Sales Trends', xlabel='Month', ylabel='Total Sales')
plt.show()
```

### 2. Profit Analysis by Time Periods
```python
# Add a profit column
orders['profit'] = orders['sales'] - orders['cost']

# Group by year and calculate total profit
yearly_profit = orders.groupby(orders['order_date'].dt.year)['profit'].sum()

# Plot the profit trend
yearly_profit.plot(kind='bar', title='Yearly Profit Analysis', xlabel='Year', ylabel='Total Profit')
plt.show()
```

### 3. Order Patterns
```python
# Extract day of the week from order date
orders['day_of_week'] = orders['order_date'].dt.day_name()

# Group by day of the week and count orders
order_patterns = orders['day_of_week'].value_counts()

# Plot the order patterns
order_patterns.plot(kind='bar', title='Orders by Day of the Week', xlabel='Day', ylabel='Number of Orders')
plt.show()
``` 

## Insights
- Monthly sales trends reveal peak seasons for e-commerce performance.
- Profitability analysis identifies the most profitable periods and potential areas for improvement.
- Order patterns provide actionable insights to optimize business strategies.
